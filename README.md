# GradeSchool3

## What This App Does
Allows substitute teachers to rate school districts and individual schools, based on factors such as salary, staff support, and levels of student misbehavior, similar to Yelp or GlassDoor. 

## Why It Matters
Substitute teachers are independent contractors. As such they have no union and word of mouth is slow and inefficient in the digital age. As demand for substitute teachers grows relative to supply, substitutes should know the best places to invest their limited time.
